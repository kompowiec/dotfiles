Multiline message: c-q
** TL;WM
In GNU Emacs ERC, pressing `RET` (Enter key) by default sends the message rather than inserting a newline (`\n`). If you want to insert a newline inside your message instead of sending it, you can modify the key bindings. Hereâ€™s how you can do that:

### Method 1: Use `C-q` (Quoted Insert)
- While typing your message in ERC, press `C-q` (which stands for `Control + q`), followed by `RET`. This inserts a literal newline without sending the message.

### Method 2: Change Key Binding for `RET`
If you want to change the behavior of the `RET` key so that it inserts a newline instead of sending the message, you can add the following to your `.emacs` or `init.el`:

```elisp
(defun my-erc-insert-newline ()
  (interactive)
  (insert "\n"))

(define-key erc-mode-map (kbd "RET") 'my-erc-insert-newline)
(define-key erc-mode-map (kbd "C-c RET") 'erc-send-current-line)
```

In this setup:
- Pressing `RET` will insert a newline.
- To send the message, you would press `C-c RET`.

This setup ensures you can format multiline messages easily.
