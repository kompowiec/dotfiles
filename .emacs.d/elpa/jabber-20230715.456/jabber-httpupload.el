;;; Commentary:

;; This file implements XEP-0363: HTTP Upload
;; (https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0363.html), providing a way to
;; send files (images, audio, etc) through XMPP clients by using
;; server space, and the HTTP protocol to upload and download from it.
;; The advantage is that the sender user does not need to be connected
;; after sharing the file, and the receiver may be disconnected while
;; the sender is uploading.

;; The procedure to send a file is as follows -

;; 1. Use Disco queries to discover if the server supports the HTTP Upload (~urn:xmpp:http:upload~ namespace).
;; 2. Request a slot to the upload Disco item. The server will answer with a GET and PUT URL.
;; 3. Upload the file to the HTTP server by using the PUT URL.
;; 4. Usually, send the GET URL to the other XMPP clients to allow them to access the uploaded file.
;;
;; TODO -
;; 1. Use wget to send the file
;; 2. Recording audio and sending

;;; Code:

;; Disco is used to discover if HTTP Upload is supported on the server
;; side. Two queries are used:

;; 1. An IQ Disco items request to get all items supported by the
;;    server.
;; 2. For each item, an IQ Disco info request to test if the item is
;;    the Upload service.

;; The namespace of the HTTP Upload feature is
;; "urn:xmpp:http:upload:0". This will be used on the second query to
;; detect which item is the upload service.

;; For more information, see XML examples at the
;; [[https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0363.html#disco][Discovering
;; Support section of XEP-0363]].

;; This implementation requires an initialization step to fill the
;; `jabber-httpupload-support' variable. This variable registers all
;; connections with their HTTP Upload item. If one of the server
;; associated to a connection does not support HTTP Upload, then it
;; will be registered with a `nil' item.
