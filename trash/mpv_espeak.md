To create a Bash script that uses `mpv` and `espeak` to read subtitles aloud, you can follow these steps. This script will extract subtitles from the video being played and use `espeak` to convert them into speech.

Here's a basic script to get you started:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure `mpv` and `espeak` are installed on your system.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install mpv espeak
   ```

3. **Make the Script Executable**:

   ```bash
   chmod +x mpv_espeak.sh
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:

   ```bash
   ./mpv_espeak.sh path/to/your/video.mp4
   ```

### Explanation

- The script checks if a video file is provided as an argument.
- A temporary file is created to store the subtitles.
- The `cleanup` function ensures the temporary file is removed when the script exits.
- `mpv` is started in the background with the subtitle file specified.
- `ffmpeg` extracts the subtitles from the video and saves them to the temporary file.
- The `read_subtitles` function reads the subtitles line by line and uses `espeak` to convert them into speech.
- The script waits for `mpv` to finish before exiting.

### Notes

- This script assumes the video has subtitles in a supported format. If not, you may need to adjust the `ffmpeg` command to extract subtitles properly.
- `tail -F` is used to continuously monitor the subtitle file for new lines, making the script responsive to subtitle changes.

This basic script should work for many cases, but depending on the specifics of your subtitle format and video files, you might need to make additional adjustments.
